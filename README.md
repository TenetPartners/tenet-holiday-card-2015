# Tenet Partners Holiday Card 2015

A short, fun questionnaire that stores and displays anonymous responses.

## Setup
Requires node and npm. `brew install node` gets you both.

1. `npm install`
2. `gulp`

## Build environment
Running `gulp` starts the development environment. All CSS and JS files are monitored and changes will automatically reload the browser via [browser-sync](http://www.browsersync.io/).

### CSS
Place Sass files in `./styles`. Write valid CSS and [autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer) will take care of any vendor prefixes.

### JavaScript
Place your scripts in `./scripts`. Uses [browserify](http://browserify.org/articles.html) to bundle all client files together.

### Images or other assets
Create a `./assets` folder to place images, downloads, or other miscellaneous files. These will be automatically copied to the `./build` folder.

### Testing
Create a `__tests__` folder next to the scripts that you would like to run tests for. To enter test driven development mode, run `gulp tdd`. This will watch your test files and source files for changes and run tests automatically as a result. Run `gulp test` to run all tests once, or run `gulp test:coverage` for a complete code coverage report.
